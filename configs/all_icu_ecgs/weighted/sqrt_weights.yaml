# Baseline configuration for all_icu_ecgs dataset with class weights (SQRT method)
# This config is specifically for the all_icu_ecgs_P1 dataset
# Class weights are calculated using Square-Root Weighting (SQINV) method
# 
# IMPORTANT: This config is dataset-specific. Do not use for other datasets!
#
# Weighting Method: Square-Root Weighting (SQINV)
# Formula: w_i = sqrt(n_total) / sqrt(n_i), then normalized to mean = 1.0
# Rationale: Square-root of inverse-frequency flattens extreme weights and
#            avoids overfitting on rare classes (common in medical/CV studies)

  # Method: Square-Root Weighting (SQINV)
  #   Formula: w_i = sqrt(n_total) / sqrt(n_i)
  # Normalized so mean = 1.0
  # Class 0: 0.76 (7,073 samples, 11.47%)
  # Class 1: 0.52 (15,085 samples, 24.46%)
  # Class 2: 0.66 (9,585 samples, 15.54%)
  # Class 3: 0.81 (6,231 samples, 10.10%)
  # Class 4: 0.97 (4,367 samples, 7.08%)
  # Class 5: 1.18 (2,973 samples, 4.82%)

  # Class 9: 0.62 (10,591 samples, 17.18%)
    # 
    # Comparison: SQRT method reduces weight range compared to balanced weighting
    # This should prevent the model from being too conservative and improve
    # learning of minority classes without extreme overfitting
