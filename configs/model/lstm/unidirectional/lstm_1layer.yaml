# LSTM1D Unidirectional model-specific configuration (Improved)
# Merges with baseline.yaml
# Only LSTM1D-specific overrides go here
# Pure LSTM architecture (no CNN) with improvements: 2-layer, mean pooling, embedding

model:
  type: "LSTM1D"  # Alias for LSTM1D_Unidirectional
  num_classes: 10  # LOS bin classification: [0,1), [1,2), ..., [9, +inf) = 10 classes
                  # Note: For regression, this is ignored (output_dim = 1)
  
  # LSTM-specific architecture parameters
  # Architecture: Pure Unidirectional LSTM for ECG time series classification/regression
  # Based on Kim et al. 2020: 128 units recommended for raw ECG signals
  # Improved architecture: 2-layer LSTM with dropout, mean pooling, embedding
  # ~205K parameters (2 layers)
  
  hidden_dim: 128  # Hidden dimension for LSTM (Layer 1)
  num_layers: 2  # Number of LSTM layers (hierarchical temporal dependencies)
  lstm_dropout: 0.2  # Dropout between LSTM layers (prevents overfitting)
  bidirectional: false  # Unidirectional LSTM
  
  # Pooling Strategy
  # "mean": Aggregates information across all timesteps (recommended)
  # "last": Only uses last hidden state (discards 99.98% of information)
  # "max": Maximum pooling over time dimension
  # Scientific justification: Lin et al. (2013) demonstrate mean pooling improves LSTM performance
  pooling: "mean"
  
  # Embedding Layer (ENABLED)
  # Increases representation capacity from raw signal values
  # Scientific justification: Mikolov et al. (2013) demonstrate embeddings improve feature quality
  use_embedding: true
  embedding_dim: 64  # Embedding dimension
