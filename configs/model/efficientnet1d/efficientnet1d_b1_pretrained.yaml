  # EfficientNet1D-B1-specific architecture parameters
  # Architecture follows EfficientNet-B1 paper (Tan & Le, 2019)
  # ~7.8M parameters
  
  # Pretrained weights configuration

    enabled: true  # Load pretrained weights for transfer learning
    weights_path: "configs/weights/pretrained_weights/efficientnet1d_b1.pt"  # Path to pretrained weights file (relative to project root or absolute)
    # NOTE: Update this path to point to your actual EfficientNet1D-B1 weights file
    # Example absolute path: "/path/to/efficientnet1d_b1.pt"
    freeze_backbone: false  # Fine-tuning: train all layers (backbone + head). Set to true for feature extraction (only train head)
